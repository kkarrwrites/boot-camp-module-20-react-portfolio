      <p>Hello! I'm K. Karr, a copy editor turned frontend web developer.</p>
      <p>
        I got my start tinkering with HTML for Expage, GeoCities, and
        LiveJournal in high school.
      </p>
      <p>
        After collecting a few degrees, living abroad for two years, and
        cultivating an eye for detail working as a copy editor for a decade, I
        returned to web development out of a strong desire to learn more about
        the technologies I use every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, and
        MongoDB.
      </p>
